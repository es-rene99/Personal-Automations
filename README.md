# Personal Automation's

Feel free to use them if you find them useful, but please remember that it is your own responsibility to make sure they work as intended.
I hope to be adding more automation's as time goes by.

## Move downloads to another folder
I recommend adding this script to your Startup Windows folder so it runs every time you start your computer. I like having my Downloads folder clean so it automatically moves them to another folder I keep as an Archive whenever I boot up, be careful as it will move all files from your Downloads folder including folders.
